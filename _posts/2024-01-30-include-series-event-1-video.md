We had our first event in IAccessible's "Include" series in December at the beautiful Microsoft Reactor location. More than 70 accessibility enthusiasts came together for a great discussion on accessibility and AI.

While the discussions were great, the networking and the connections made were even better.
Here is a video of the event for those who missed it.
