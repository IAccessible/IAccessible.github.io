I was visiting Vienna, Austria last week. I was enjoying the accessible public transport , pedestrian signals, good austrian wine and everything. 
We had a few hours to kill Wednesday evening and to give my 9 year old daughter some entertainment, we decided to go the prater amusement park in Vienna.
Here is what happened after a few fun rides as we walked up to a reasonably scary looking indoor roller coaster:
* ride guy: You cannot go in!
* me: why? (puzzled)
* ride guy: You are blind (having noticed my white cane).
* me: So?
* ride guy: It is dark inside. You will not be able to find your way.

I was speechless for a few seconds. Where do I begin to argue with this?
Arguing did not do any good anyway, and we could not budge him from his firm beleif in my inability to ride that ride.

I was thinking that you can put in all the accessibility technology and infrastructure in a place but how do you resolve the inaccessibility caused by "human bias"?

If you are an eternal optimist like me, you would also think this was maybe the case of a one off "ignorant a**hole". So, we walk up to the next scary looking ride that was open to broad daylight.
* ride guy: You cannot go in!
* me: why? (already knowing the answer this time)
* ride guy: You are blind.
* me: So?
* ride guy: This ride is 30 meters tall.
* me: So?
* Ride guy: What if the ride gets stuck when you are up there and you black out. How will I get you down?
* me: How will you get down any of these other people if they black out with a stuck ride? How will you get my 9-year old daughter down when you are willing to let her go on the ride?
* ride guy: I don't care, I cannot let you in. You can get your money back from the window.

I think, in his head, this man thought that a blind person is someone who has "blacked out" permanently.

I was surprised but not too much. I have seen this "human bias" about infantilizing someone with a disability, this attempt to protect them from themselves. The thinking that you can know better than this person with a disability about what they should and should not be doing.

It pervades everything in society, including work, where people with disabilities are not considered "able" to do more complex or harder more senior roles. 

I am curious about how we can remove this bias. How do we have people with disabilities be seen as having more capabilities? how do we get people not be "inspired" when they see someone with a disability do something mundane and everyday on their own?

I have seen some of this bias fade away over time from people I have worked with and so, I think maybe more exposure to people with disabilities will help releive some pain here.
* Exposure through education, specially in higher ed courses. 
* exposure in media, maybe?
* Definitely more exposure at work by hiring more people with disabilities.
* training programs at work, specially for public facing roles like the above "ride guys" or the customer service reps.

If you have thoughts on how we can start to chip away at this human bias, please add in your comments!
