It is already that time of the year. The CSUN 2025 conference is coming up March 10 - 14, 2025.  

I am excited to represent IAccessible at the conference and cannot wait to meet the accessibility community. We have a booth, 214, in the exhibit hall.  
I will also be presenting this session about my recommendations to work places and higher Ed institutions on how to use AI for inclusion:  
AI for Inclusion: Strategies and Tools

Tuesday, 3/12/25 11:20 AM - 12:00 PM PT

Location: Elite 1-3

If you are attending the conference, I would love to meet you. Please drop me a note and we can schedule a time to meet.
