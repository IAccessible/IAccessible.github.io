I had some friends over this weekend. We were chatting away in my study late into the night. It was about 2 AM and we were in the middle of some "solve the world hunger" kind of discussion when suddenly, there was that moment when everyone on the room goes silent. The silence was, however, filled with the sound of someone laughing. The laughter of a woman that was not amused or happy but was in fact very ghostly in nature. The laughter was from no one sitting in the room.  
It was by far the scariest thing that has happened in the recent past to me. 

If my wife had not had the presence of mind to realize that it was the amazon echo device sitting on my desk in the corner that had laughed, I am not sure what we would have done that night.  
We were talking in hindi and the echo had construed something to be the wake word "alexa" followed by something else that made it laugh that scary laugh.  
Maybe there should be an option in the settings to always play a beep or ding sound before or after alexa utters something. This will always tell the listener human that it was the device talking or laughing in this instance.  
Amazon should also fix alexa's laughter to be not so scary anyway.
