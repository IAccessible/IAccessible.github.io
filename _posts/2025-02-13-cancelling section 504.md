They want to take away my rights: cancelling Section 504

In a disheartening turn of events, 17* states are currently pushing to dismantle Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a vital piece of legislation that safeguards the basic civil rights of over 60 million individuals living with disabilities in the US. 
This move threatens to erode the progress that has been made over the past five decades in advancing equality and accessibility for people with disabilities.

## what do people with disabilities lose if section 504 is dismantled?
The law ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to education, employment, housing, and public services.

I am not a lawyer but here are some examples I have read about of the rights and protections that would be lost if Section 504 were to be dismantled :
* Access to Education: Parents of children with disabilities will no longer be able to ask public schools to provide the required accomodations and support - no more IEPs or accessible study material .
* Employment Protections: Employers would no longer be required to refrain from discrimnatory practices or to even provide basic accommodations like an accessible washroom in the workplace.
* Housing Rights: A landlord can deny renting their house to someone, just because they have a disability,  making it more difficult to find accessible and affordable living options.
* Public Services: I will no longer be able to depend on access to essential public services, such as transportation and healthcare. Uber and Lyft can deny me because I have a service animal.

I could go on and on about the examples
about how such actions would undermine the rights of millions of Americans with disabilities and set a dangerous precedent for the erosion of civil rights protections.

The impact on individuals with disabilities would be uniformly devastating.
## Why We Must Act
People with disabilities already face significant challenges and barriers in their daily lives. Section 504 provides a crucial framework for mitigating these challenges and ensuring that individuals with disabilities can lead fulfilling and independent lives. Dismantling these protections would reverse years of progress and force individuals with disabilities back into the shadows of society, where their needs and rights are ignored.
## What You Can Do
It is imperative that we take action to defend Section 504 and the rights it protects. Here are some practical steps you can take:
* Raise Awareness:
  Use social media and your networks to highlight the importance of Section 504 and the threats it faces. Educate others about its rights and protections.
* Contact Representatives:
  Express your opposition to dismantling Section 504 to local, state, and federal representatives. Share personal stories and data to make a compelling case.
* Join Advocacy Groups:
  Align with disability rights organizations working to protect Section 504. Support their campaigns and strategies.
* Host or Attend Events:
  Participate in community events, town halls, and public forums to discuss Section 504 and mobilize support.
* Support Legal Action:
  Contribute to legal funds or organizations prepared to challenge attempts to dismantle Section 504 in court.

In conclusion, the push to dismantle Section 504 is an affront to the values of equality and justice that underpin our society. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that people with disabilities continue to have the protections and opportunities they deserve. By taking action now, we can preserve the progress that has been made and continue to build a more inclusive and equitable future for all.
