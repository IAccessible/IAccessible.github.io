IAccessible was present at the Disability:in conference for the first time this year in Las Vegas. It was one of the best represented conferences I have attended in terms of mainstream enterprises and organizations vying to show their commitment to disability inclusion.

We conducted this quarter's edition of "IAccessible's Include series" as a couple of networking meetups on the sidelines of the conference.

We got to meet accessibility related people in many roles from HR to procurement to product managers and hear their stories and challenges. It was envigourating to realize that IAccessible's mission of connecting organizations to people with lived experience of disabilities resonated so well with all of them. 

The learnings and connections we made at the conference will help us in honing our offerings even more to align with the industry because for a change, this time, what happened in Vegas will not just stay in Vegas!
