I tried using the Adobe Firefly tool recently and was blown away with what I can do with it. I never felt as empowered to express as a blind user what I want in a drawing in so much detail.  
It was helpful that the tool was very accessible with a screen reader. It would have been even better  if the drawing options generated by the tool were auto described in text by the AI that was drawing them for me to allow me to distinguish between them .
I captured my experience in this short video:
