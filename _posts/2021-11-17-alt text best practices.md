I answer a bunch of accessibility questions everyday for testers and developers and more often than not, I do an internet search and find the most reliable, comprehensive and  relevant answer across.  

I will try to start adding those searched links here as blog posts along with the questions for my own future reference and in the hope that it will help others.

Q: Should we have alt text for background images?  
A: the short answer is no. However, I found a more comprehensive and accurate answer here: [Alternate text for background images, alt text accessibility (davidmacd.com)](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html)
