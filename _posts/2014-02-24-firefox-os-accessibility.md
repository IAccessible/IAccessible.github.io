Came across this update on [accessibility in the upcoming Firefox OS](http://www.marcozehe.de/2014/02/23/accessibility-in-firefox-os-an-update/).
The developers seem to be going in the right direction. I wish they will involve users right from this stage to get feedback on what works and what doesn't. Otherwise, it is usually a very long loop to get things just right.
