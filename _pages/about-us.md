We are a social enterprise with years of experience  empowering people with disabilities to drive accessibility.  
We work with many non-profits  to train and hire people with disabilities, including people who are blind, have low vision, have Cerebral Palsy, and Autism.  

Our testers are not just certified trusted testers but also are expert assistive technology users. We bring to the table the unique perspective of real users of accessibility technologies who understand the criticality of accessibility compliance and usability and its impact through our own lived experiences.
