## [AudioLabeller](/audiolabeller) app released to the Android [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.iaccessible.audioLabeller)
We just released the [AudioLabeller app](/audiolabeller).  
You can now use your android phone to create audio labels from NFC tags. No longer do you need to buy and maintain a separate device like a Pen friend or similar. So long as you have an NFC enabled android phone, simply buy off the shelf NFC tags and create audio labels that can be easily copied across devices, backed up on the cloud and are available whenever your phone is handy.  

## Some recently conducted accessibility workshops included:  
- A workshop conducted for developers from several companies and organizations building Web applications for the Government of Maharashtra, India.  
- Several comprehensive workshops for the National Informatics Center (NIC), Government of India.  
- A workshop and hands-on session conducted for Masters of Computer Application (MCA) students from several institutions organized by the think tank Center for Internet and Society (CIS).
