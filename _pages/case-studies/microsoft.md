## Compass Group partners with IAccessible to improve cafe experiences at Microsoft
Compass group USA manages the Cafe and dining facilities for the Global Workplace Services (GWS) team at Microsoft. They frequently introduce innovative technologies in these dining areas in the form of different vending machines for food and beverages.
In keeping with Microsoft's commitment to create inclusive and accessible office spaces for their employees, the Compass group needs to ensure their innovations are accessible for people with disabilities.

## IAccessible connects the Compass group to people with disabilities
IAccessible partnered with the Compass group to create a light weight process to get accessibility feedback from real users with disabilities. 
The inputs from these users will help the Compass group determine which inovations were ready to deploy for the dining areas and what improvements were still required.

### The Rammon Vending Car
The Compass group wanted to introduce a rammon vending car that people in a Microsoft office can summon with a mobile app to their desk to have a bowl of rammon delivered.
IAccessible brought in users with blind and low vision to validate if the end-to-end experience with the mobile app and the vending machine was accessible and usable.

### Lightweight process for useful feedback
The ability to get rapid feedback from real users allowed the Compass group to make fast business decisions without going through a lengthy assessment process.
The innovations being introduced b y the Compass group were not typical Web applications and could not be assessed by trusted tester teams as is usually done by accessibility vendors.
