## Adobe Cocreates with IAccessible
Adobe is partnering with Iaccessible to cocreate a truly inclusive Universal editor for the Adobe Experience Manager. 

## Wysiwig content editors are hard to make accessible.
Content authoring tools with rich design surfaces and wysiwyg editors have been hard to make accessible and usable for assistive technology users. There are no well-known standard solutions to make the selection and layout of elements on a design canvas to be accessible.
Adobe plans to innovatively design the next generation of its content editor in the AEM platform to be accessible and efficient to use by everyone.

## We iteratively design components with inputs from real users.
Iaccessible reviews each design iteration of the new editor with a group of expert assistive technology users to help find and resolve accessibility and usability problems early in the development lifecycle.
Iaccessible also provides design guidance for complex accessibility problems. Iaccessible does research with existing industry solutions for similar problems and collects user inputs. The Adobe and Iaccessible teams then prototype the suggested designs  to further iterate to get feedback from users with disabilities.

## How to make the selection and layout of elements on a design canvas accessible?
An example of such a problem was the “Selection tool”, which allows various components in the wysiwig editor to be selected with a mouse. The way this tool was originally designed, it could only be used with a mouse and was completely unusable for keyboard-only and screen reader users. 
Iaccessible worked with screen reader users and design experts who reviewed the accessibility of existing solutions in products with a similar design surface, such as Wordpress and PowerPoint. 
We then proposed an innovative keyboarding paradigm to make the selection tool accessible and efficiently usable by screen reader users. We ensured that this paradigm retains any existing patterns familiar to screen reader users while overcoming the known problems of those solutions.

## The solution will be built on the premise of “Nothing about us without us”.
When implemented, the innovative content editor will be an example of designing with people with disabilities and not for them. With inputs from users with various disabilities in every stage of the development lifecycle, Adobe would be able to create the “right” product the first time rather than trying to retrofit it later for accessibility compliance.

## The engineering team found this process “eye opening”!
“These reviews were an eye-opening exercise for us.” – Engineering lead for the Universal editor
“We want to go beyond a checklist and make this really usable and not just compliant” – Accessibility lead, Adobe.
